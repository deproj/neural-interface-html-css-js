# 🧠 Neural Interface Prototype v2.1
🔗 **Live Preview**: [Open Neural Interface](https://deproj.github.io/neural-interface-html-css-js/)

> “What you see here is only the beginning.”

This is an **experimental neural UI shell** — a prototype of a futuristic interaction system built for mobile.  
Designed to feel alive, immersive, and dynamic, it demonstrates the *first layer* of what's possible.

## 🔥 Live Features

- ⚡ **Terminal Interface**  
  Type commands like `/help`, `/system`, `/scan`, `/matrix`, `/glitch`, `/modal`, `/open`, etc.

- 🧬 **Visual Effects Engine**  
  Glitching, matrix overlays, pulse animations, and system transitions.

- 🧠 **Neural UI Panel** (`/open`)  
  Early version of the neural app launcher. Fullscreen layout with app icons and return link.

- 💬 **Interactive Command Responses**  
  Replies simulate real system feedback. Commands animate and process dynamically.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

> This prototype is just the **first spark**. Planned expansions include:

- ✅ **AI integration** (personalized assistant layer)
- ✅ **Voice and biometric input simulation**
- ✅ **Portable interface layers** for wearables and IoT
- ✅ **Cloud interaction bridge**
- ✅ **App engine & internal file routing**
- ✅ **Offline-first optimizations & data sync**
